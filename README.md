### How's it going, lads ðŸ‘‹
Thanks for checking out my profile on this here Guthub. You're probably reading this text because you searched "donkhouse github," and my profile was the top result. And while I'd love to share my codebase with those of you who genuinely want to help, I've spent far too much time on it to risk the rise of copycat sites. I love working on this platformâ€“â€“it's by far the largest project I've ever dreamed up, and I love how much you all seem to be enjoying it. If you'd like to get in touch about anything related to the Donkhouse, feel free to tweet me [@DonkhousePoker](https://twitter.com/DonkhousePoker).

If you're here for another reason, I appreciate you, too. I have a few additional projects that may interest you:
 - [Automatic Playtesting for Yahtzee](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9231924), a dive into the use of reinforcement learning to develop near-optimal agents based on neural networksâ€“â€“and how their skill at various levels of resource constraints tells us something about the depth of a given game. <[code](https://github.com/robb17/YahtzeeLearning)>
 - [csofficehours.org](http://csofficehours.org), an online implementation of a queue system. Students sign up for a place in line, and instructors join session links provided by the students. Features include text chatting, video chat integration, customizable email preferences for instructors, and much more. Very straightforward interface.
 - [movie-spark.com](http://movie-spark.com), a movie recommendation platform that I developed for a class some years back. The site makes better recommendations as it gets feedback from its users! Pretty rough around the edges, but remarkably functional for a week-long project. <[code](https://github.com/robb17/MovieSpark)>
 - PLOAI, an attempt to create an agent capable of playing pot-limit Omaha. I pretty much made progress only in the area of decreasing state space via abstraction. <[code](https://github.com/robb17/PLOAI)>
